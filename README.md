# eslint-config
This repo contains our various [eslint][eslint-url] configuration packages. These packages are published to the [npm registry][npmjs-url] and should be consumed from there. 

Our configurations are defined in three different categories: rule configurations, global/environment configurations, and bundles intended for end consumption. 

Check out the details on our various [eslint config bundles][bundles-docs].
